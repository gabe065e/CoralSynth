This dual oscillator synth has traditional ADSR functionality, as well as gain, noise, and pitch sliders.
Three wavetypes are available: Saw, Sin, and Square. The Saw wave is approximated using a summation which can be easily modified from within OscData.cpp.
An additional parameter is available, nicknamed drift. It modifies the frequency of Oscillator 1, creating a dynamic and desynchronized sound no matter what notes are played.
